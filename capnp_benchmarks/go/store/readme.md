This package contains the [specification.capnp.go](specification.capnpn.go) file.
It is generated by the [library](github.com/zombiezen/go-capnproto2).
The generated code includes functions to make a new capnp message, set the content of the fields, encode/decode the message, get the content of the fields...

The generated code depends on the [input schema](../../specification.capnp), and as such changing the schema and running `go generate` will also change this file.
